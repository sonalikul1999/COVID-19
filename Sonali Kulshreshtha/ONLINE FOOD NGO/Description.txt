Currently, during this pandemic many people in the country wants to
help our nation. They wants to serve themselves in any way but we don’t
want anyone to come out. Our idea is to develop a online web portal
where anyone can register where he/she will be asked few questions
like their name, email, phone number, how many lunch boxes they can
provide (minimum one lunchbox) per day? and for how many days they
can provide? Accordingly government emergency vehicles will collect
all the lunchboxes from specific city or area and donate it to the
most needy one.
